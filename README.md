### Project Description
[A simple and secure password generator that helps to create strong ,random passwords to enhance online security.]

### The Problem statement
[weak passwords can be easily guessed or cracked by others,leading to unauthorized accessand potential data breaches.Furthermore the use of weak passwords can also compromise sensitive user information causing irreparable damge to individuals and organizations.
 

### The Solution
[To solve the Password Generator problem, create a form with options for the user to select password length (6-30 characters) and character types (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, special characters) through checkboxes. Validate that at least one checkbox is selected before generating a password. Based on selected options randomly generate a password of the specified length . Display the generated password in a text field and provide a "Copy" button to allow users to copy the password to their clipboard. Ensure proper input validation and handle edge cases.]
